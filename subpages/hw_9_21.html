    <p style ="font-family:Verdana">John Berger's short series "Ways of Seeing" is an insightful perspective on understanding the power of imagery and art, but also how the medium is manipulated. Berger describes art as a form of communication, similar to a written language, where the details and illustrations are words. The medium is also highly manipulative depending on its presentation, such as the environment and perspective it is being observed with.</p>
    <p style ="font-family:Verdana">One example that Berger discusses that I found interesting was the way imagery is used in advertising. Many ads illustrate an idealized scene, full of smiles, neat scenery and styling, and more. It does not just show the benefits of the product, but subconsiously communicates that the product advertised would make us happier and better by having idealized characters.</p>
