    <p>Vannevar Bush's article "As We May Think" is a stunningly accurate and relevant essay about technology and its future. While many often joke about how fantastical and innacurate predictions from the 40s, 50s, and 60s were about modern society, Bush's thoughts, although from 1945, predicted many broad ideas of the development of tech for the past 77 years.</p>
    <p>Bush discusses the rise of new ideas and technologies that were current during the time of writing, such as new techniques in photography and typewritters. He discusses how many in the past thought these new inventions were not possible, but through science and creativity, have materialized into revolutionary products. Bush discusses how these new technologies will continue in the future, and how many ideas that may be seen as impossible will be done in the future.</p>
    <p>Examples of these would be the file system Bush describes. Bush imagines a file system that could store thousands of pages of different books in the space of the corner of a desk. From a modern perspective, the personal computer comes to mind - something that stores countless of files, but can also do much more.</p>
